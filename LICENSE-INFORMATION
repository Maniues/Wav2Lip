License history
The original software was originally described as "licensed under the MIT License." Then I (Maniues) noticed that the license file was missing, so I added it myself. During the review, the authors stated that the MIT license was not appropriate when they wrote something else in README. Then when I said "License: MIT" in readme, they apologized for the error and corrected it as "for non-commercial / research use". Before that, I cloned the repo in case of any irregularities.
Now it's not entirely clear what this repository is licensed for, as I cloned the original repo before changing the license to the original. All my contributions to these repos are licensed under the terms of the psh license (the license for the project I resigned from.) So the terms are:
- You are 100% free to use this program for non-commercial purposes
- This version is licensed under the terms of the MIT listed below
- All my contributions are licensed under the psh license.
- You may use this software for commercial use under MIT, but I am not entirely sure about the legal status of this software (ie if the software belongs to any university etc.).
- I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS IS AVAILABLE AS A MYTH OR COMMERCIAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE.
IF THE AUTHORS WRITE TO ME FOR THIS REASON, I WILL EXPLAIN THIS ISSUE WITH THEM AND I WILL UPDATE THE TERMS.
